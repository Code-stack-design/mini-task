Today I finally tried ReactJS and built my first mini app that says “Hello React!”
I used to think it was too complex, but once I broke it into small parts, it made sense!
Feeling more confident now 😊

React always felt overwhelming, with all the JSX and component stuff. But I gave it a try and was surprised how fun and powerful it feels!
Excited to learn more! 💻✨
